### Background:
The forest fire model is a grid-based simulation that illustrates how fires spread through a forest. Each grid cell can either be empty or contain a tree in one of three states: unburned, on fire, or burned out. Fire propagates from on-fire trees to adjacent unburned trees, which then transition to a burned state. The simulation persists until all fires are extinguished. Initially, the model was designed to explore fire dynamics across different forest densities.
In the first assignment, I enhanced the model by incorporating internal characteristics of tree: tree combustibility, categorizing trees as either "Highly Combustible" (Flammable) or "Less Combustible" (Resistant). This classification allows for varied fire spread behaviors based on tree properties. For second assignment, I have added further complexity and realism by introducing an exteral force for fire spreading in forest: a new agent "Wind". This models how wind's various activation probability and influence radius impact fire spread dynamics.

### Design Concepts:
At the beginning of the simulation, the model populates a grid based on a specified density, randomly placing trees. Each tree receives a combustibility attribute—either "Flammable" or "Resistant"—based on the Flammable_ratio. This attribute dictates how susceptible a tree is to catching fire from neighboring burning trees.

In the updated model, wind serves as a dynamic external factor that significantly enhances fire spread among trees. Normally, an "on fire" tree affects only its immediate neighbors with a spread radius of 1. However, with the introduction of the Wind class, this influence can be extended up to a radius of 30. The impact of wind on forest fire dynamics is determined by three aspects: generation, activation, and influence radius. Each model step potentially generates a wind package based on the wind_chance parameter. If the randomly generated number is less than wind_chance, a wind package is generated and assigned a random location with a specific influence radius determined by the wind_radius parameter. If this wind package happen to be generated "near" "on fire" trees and its radius reaches these trees, the wind's influence is activated. This activation increases the fire spread radius of "on fire" trees that are under wind influence from the standard 1 to the user-defined wind_radius, as set by the 'wind_radius' slider. This adjustment alters the typical fire spread speed and increases the probability of irregular fire edges. Once a wind agent has influenced fire spread in a step, it is deactivated(Therefore, in each step, a maximum of one wind package can be activated). This enhancement adds a layer of realism to the simulation, demonstrating how natural elements like wind can dramatically alter the behavior of forest fires.
